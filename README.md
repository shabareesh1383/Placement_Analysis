# Data Analysis on Placement Data  

## Project Overview  
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis EDA on placement data to uncover trends insights and patterns that help understand the factors influencing student placements  

## Dataset Information  
The dataset contains various attributes related to students such as academic performance test scores and placement status The analysis includes  
- Understanding the data structure columns data types missing values  
- Visualizing trends using statistical plots  
- Identifying correlations between features  
- Exploring categorical and numerical distributions  

## Steps in Data Analysis  

### 1 Data Preprocessing  
- Load the dataset  
- Handle missing values  
- Convert categorical columns if necessary  
- Check data types and fix inconsistencies  

### 2 Exploratory Data Analysis EDA  
- Univariate Analysis  
  - Histograms and KDE plots for numerical variables  
  - Count plots for categorical variables  

- Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis  
  - Scatter plots to analyze relationships  
  - Box plots to identify outliers  
  - Heatmaps to check feature correlation  
  - Pair plots for combined insights  

### 3 Insights and Trends  
- Trends in placement success rates  
- Impact of academic scores on placements  
- Feature correlations and key influencing factors  
- Salary distribution analysis for placed students  

## Key Findings  
- Strong correlation between CGPA and placement success  
- Certain skills and test scores highly impact placement probability  
- Outliers in salary distributions affecting overall trends
